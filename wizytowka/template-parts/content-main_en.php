    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Wojtek and I’m a freelancer specializing in creating websites.</p>

      <p>I’ve always been fascinated by technology and its impact on our daily lives, which is why I decided to pursue a career in building modern and functional websites. I treat every project as a challenge and an opportunity to learn - and quickly picking up new skills is one of my strongest traits.</p>

      <p>I’m not afraid of new technologies, and difficulties motivate me to take action. I consistently strive to achieve my goals while paying attention to aesthetics, usability, and detail. I believe in continuous development, so I’m constantly expanding my knowledge in front-end development, WordPress, and PHP. This allows me to better respond to my clients’ needs and create projects that not only look good but also perform well - fast, smoothly, and reliably.</p>

      <p>In my work, I value communication, reliability, and meeting deadlines. I enjoy challenges and gladly take on new projects that let me use both creativity and logical thinking.</p>

      <p>If you’re looking for someone who can not only build a website but also help turn your idea into a real, well-functioning product - I’d love to work with you!</p>
